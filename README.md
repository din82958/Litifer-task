# Litifer-task
unity version - 2019.3.9f1

As per the given task in UNITY 3D 
I have created a Splash screen / Loading screen.
I have implemented AsyncOperation to wait for the next scene to run in background.
Implemented Progress bar synced with the AsyncOperation to load the progress bar.
Used Coroutine to wait for the splash screen and the Progress bar to load.
Created Home screen which would display a scrollable list of images.
The Scroll Rect is implemented and the scroll is made horizontal.
Album images are fetched while in the screen.
 Images are loaded using Unity Web Request to access webpages (the link thatâ€™s provided in the task).
